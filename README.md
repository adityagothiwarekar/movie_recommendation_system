# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This is a simple movie recommendation system that recommends similar movies based on the user's input using cosine similarity. The system uses a dataset of movies and their respective genres.

# Requirements

Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Dataset
TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

# Methodology

The recommendation system is based on the content-based filtering technique. This technique recommends similar items based on their attributes. In this case, we are recommending movies based on their genre.

The system calculates the similarity between movies using the cosine similarity metric. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
