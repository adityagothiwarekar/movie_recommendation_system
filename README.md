# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This is a simple movie recommendation system that recommends similar movies based on the user's input using cosine similarity. The system uses a dataset of movies and their respective genres.

# Requirements

Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MovieLens 100K dataset, which consists of 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies.

# Methodology

The recommendation system is based on the content-based filtering technique. This technique recommends similar items based on their attributes. In this case, we are recommending movies based on their genre.

The system calculates the similarity between movies using the cosine similarity metric. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
